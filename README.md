# Master thesis

## *Quantum Computing on Cloud-Based Processors*

I did my masters thesis at Stellenbosch University in South Africa on quantum computing applications and experimental optics under the supervision of Mark Tame.

## Template

This template is amalgamation of a few beautiful documents mostly found over at [Showcases of beautiful typography in LaTeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1319/showcase-of-beautiful-typography-done-in-tex-friends) and across the interwebs:

- [Castel's thesis](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1U_wQyZYw_pE0c4ewPJI3QJujf9lnGjuJ)
- [Turon's thesis](http://aturon.github.io/academic/turon-thesis.pdf)
- [Eivind Uggedal's thesis](https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/9955/uggedal.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)

- The ornaments in title and colophon page are from the package `pgfornament`
- Calligraphy first letter in a chapter [stackoverflow](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/769/how-can-i-create-documents-in-latex-using-a-calligraphic-first-letter-for-chapter)
- Robert Slimbachâ€™s Jenson Pro is used as the main font. Sans-serif text is typeset in Hermann Zapf's URW Classico and sometimes Volker Schnebel's URW DIN; monospaced text uses Raph Levien's Inconsolata.
- Most figures were made with `inkscape`, `matplotlib`, `yquant `and `tikzit` and tables with `booktabs`

### Bibliography

- `biblatex`
